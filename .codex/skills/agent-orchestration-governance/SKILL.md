# Hussh Agent Orchestration Governance Skill

## Purpose and Trigger

- Primary scope: `agent-orchestration-governance-intake`
- Trigger on repo-scoped Codex custom-agent authoring, `.codex/config.toml` subagent limits, delegation policy, child handoff contracts, or workflow changes that govern how Codex orchestrates bounded parallel work in this repo.
- Avoid overlap with `codex-skill-authoring` for generic skill taxonomy changes and `repo-context` for broad repository intake.

## Coverage and Ownership

- Role: `owner`
- Owner family: `agent-orchestration-governance`

Owned repo surfaces:

1. `.codex/agents`
2. `.codex/config.toml`
3. `.codex/skills/agent-orchestration-governance`
4. `.codex/workflows/agent-orchestration-governance`
5. `AGENTS.md`
6. `docs/reference/operations/README.md`
7. `docs/reference/operations/coding-agent-mcp.md`

Non-owned surfaces:

1. `repo-context`
2. `codex-skill-authoring`
3. `repo-operations`
4. `future-planner`

## Do Use

1. Adding or tightening project-scoped custom agents under `.codex/agents/`.
2. Changing repo-level concurrency or depth limits under `.codex/config.toml`.
3. Defining or tightening delegation boundaries, authority rules, or child handoff structure.
4. Keeping repo-scoped agent behavior thin and routed through existing skills instead of duplicating domain guidance.
5. Validating that repo custom agents stay read-first unless a narrower exception is deliberate and documented.

## Do Not Use

1. Broad repo scans that should start with `repo-context`.
2. Generic skill creation or taxonomy work that belongs to `codex-skill-authoring`.
3. Domain implementation work in frontend, backend, security, or repo operations after the correct owner lane is already clear.
4. Recursive multi-agent expansion beyond the bounded defaults unless a later review explicitly proves the need.

## Read First

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `.codex/skills/agent-orchestration-governance/references/delegation-contract.md`
3. `.codex/skills/codex-skill-authoring/references/skill-contract.md`
4. `.codex/skills/codex-skill-authoring/references/truth-first-operating-kernel.md`
5. `docs/reference/operations/coding-agent-mcp.md`

## Workflow

1. Verify that a repo-scoped custom agent is actually justified before adding one; prefer skills and workflows when role specialization is not needed.
2. Keep the agent fleet at the curated sweet spot: broad evidence lanes, not one agent per skill. Add a new agent only when a recurring high-risk evidence family crosses multiple skills and existing agents have repeatedly missed it.
3. Preserve the project-wide delegation checkpoint in `AGENTS.md` before narrowing behavior in any skill or workflow:
   - run the project-wide premise verification gate before delegation; agents are evidence lanes, not agreement lanes
   - classify important prompt claims as `already_exists`, `partially_exists`, `missing`, `future_state_only`, `wrong_direction`, or `needs_verification` before final synthesis
   - use subagents only when the user explicitly allows delegation or a repo workflow/global repo policy has an approved delegation step
   - treat every non-trivial repo workflow as eligible for read-only evidence lanes when the checkpoint passes
  - treat high-stakes PR governance, RCA, release readiness, security/consent review, schema/migration review, docs/founder-language work, founder wiki north-star review, analytics/observability work, mobile/native work, frontend/backend contract review, and voice/action-runtime review as especially strong delegation candidates
   - use `.codex/skills/agent-orchestration-governance/scripts/delegation_router.py` at prompt intake or mid-execution when prompt/path intent is ambiguous
   - require independent evidence lanes and a concrete handoff shape
   - keep final authority with the parent session or `governor`
   - record why delegation was skipped when a high-stakes workflow stays local
   - keep delegated handoffs aligned to the shared truth-first operating kernel: claim inspected, classification, evidence checked, current repo truth, real gap, suggested boundary, and blind-acceptance risk
4. Keep custom-agent TOML files thin:
   - define role, sandbox, nicknames, and concise behavioral instructions
   - route domain knowledge back to existing repo skills instead of copying it into agent files
   - set `default_reasoning_effort` to `high` or `xhigh`; governor, reviewer, security/consent, and voice/action agents should default to `xhigh`
5. Keep wave-1 repo custom agents read-only by default and leave edits to the parent session or the built-in `worker`.
6. Keep branch authority with the parent session and `repo-operations`:
   - delegated agents must not create, switch, delete, or push branches unless the parent explicitly scopes that as their task
   - handoffs must report if they observed branch drift, detached HEAD state, or temporary-branch risk
   - workers that edit files inherit the parent branch and must not use branch isolation as a default safety mechanism
7. Keep global limits bounded in `.codex/config.toml`:
   - `max_threads = 6`
   - `max_depth = 1`
8. Encode the authority boundary directly:
   - only `governor` produces final merge, deploy, or plan recommendations inside delegated workflows
   - child agents return evidence and judgments, not final authority
9. Require every delegated handoff to include:
   - `claim_inspected`
   - `classification`
   - `evidence_checked`
   - `current_repo_truth`
   - `real_gap`
   - `suggested_boundary`
   - `risk_if_prompt_is_accepted_blindly`
   - `scope_covered`
   - `inspected_surfaces`
   - `assumptions`
   - `validations_run`
   - `unresolved_risks`
10. For material product direction, founder language, One/Kai/Nav ontology, PCHP/BYOA/on-device posture, PKM/World Model authority, or PR north-star review, route product-docs evidence lanes through the Founder Wiki North-Star Probe. Child agents may read wiki evidence, but must remain read-only and must keep private wiki evidence local-only. If repo truth and wiki canon disagree, report `current_state_vs_north_star_drift`.
11. When changing this surface, keep docs and workflow routing aligned with the actual agent/config files.
12. Add a mid-execution delegation recheck to workflows that can discover new authority lanes after initial intake, especially PR governance, RCA, release readiness, and security/consent review.
13. Treat self-maintenance as drift detection plus CI enforcement, not autonomous self-rewrite or bot mutation.
14. Run the dedicated agent-orchestration validation and fleet audit first, then the router smoke tests, repo governance check, skill lint, and audit.

## Handoff Rules

1. Route broad repo intake to `repo-context`.
2. Route generic skill-system authoring or taxonomy maintenance to `codex-skill-authoring`.
3. Route CI, deploy, or runtime-governance follow-up to `repo-operations`.
4. Route future-state agent-lattice planning or expansion reviews to `future-planner`.
5. Route domain-specific implementation work back to the relevant owner skill once orchestration policy is settled.
