# Repo-Local Skill Contract

This is the canonical contract for the Codex operating system under `.codex/skills/` and `.codex/workflows/`.

The shared truth-first reasoning contract lives at `.codex/skills/codex-skill-authoring/references/truth-first-operating-kernel.md`. Every repo-local skill and workflow inherits that operating kernel.

## Machine-readable source of truth

Every repo-local skill must have:

1. `SKILL.md`: thin human procedure layer
2. `skill.json`: machine-readable routing and impact-analysis layer

Every workflow pack must have:

1. `.codex/workflows/<workflow-id>/workflow.json`
2. `.codex/workflows/<workflow-id>/PLAYBOOK.md`

`skill.json` and `workflow.json` are the canonical machine-readable source of truth.

## Required sections

Every `SKILL.md` must contain these sections exactly once and in this order:

1. `## Purpose and Trigger`
2. `## Coverage and Ownership`
3. `## Do Use`
4. `## Do Not Use`
5. `## Read First`
6. `## Workflow`
7. `## Handoff Rules`
8. `## Required Checks`

## Purpose and Trigger rules

Every repo-local skill must declare:

- `Primary scope: \`...\``
- `Trigger on ...`
- `Avoid overlap with ...`

The primary scope must be unique across the local skill fleet.

## Coverage and Ownership rules

Every repo-local skill must declare:

- `Role: \`owner\`` or `Role: \`spoke\``
- `Owner family: \`...\``
- `Owned repo surfaces:` with explicit repo paths in backticks
- `Non-owned surfaces:` with explicit repo paths or sibling owner domains in backticks

Owner-skill rules:

1. The skill folder name must match `Owner family`.
2. Owner skills are the default entrypoint for broad requests in that domain.
3. Every meaningful repo surface must map to at least one owner skill.

Spoke-skill rules:

1. `Owner family` must point at an existing owner skill.
2. Spokes reject broad intake and route broad requests back to their owner.
3. Spokes own narrower contracts, paths, or workflows inside the owner family.

## Skill manifest rules

Every `skill.json` must define:

1. `id`
2. `role`
3. `owner_family`
4. `primary_scope`
5. `description`
6. `owned_paths`
7. `non_owned_paths`
8. `task_types`
9. `required_reads`
10. `required_commands`
11. `verification_bundles`
12. `handoff_targets`
13. `adjacent_skills`
14. `risk_tags`

Parity rules:

1. `description`, `primary_scope`, `role`, `owner_family`, `owned_paths`, and `required_reads` must stay aligned with `SKILL.md`.
2. `task_types` must map to actual workflow packs.
3. `verification_bundles` must be present and non-empty.

## Workflow-pack rules

Every `workflow.json` must define:

1. `id`
2. `title`
3. `goal`
4. `owner_skill`
5. `default_spoke`
6. `task_type`
7. `affected_surfaces`
8. `required_reads`
9. `required_commands`
10. `verification_bundle`
11. `deliverables`
12. `impact_fields`
13. `handoff_chain`
14. `common_failures`

Workflow-routing rules:

1. Routing is deterministic by workflow id, not natural-language guessing.
2. `owner_skill` must be an owner skill.
3. `default_spoke` may be null, but when present it must resolve to a spoke skill.
4. `task_type` must equal workflow id for deterministic routing.

## Authoring rules

1. Keep `SKILL.md` thin and procedural.
2. Put bulky details into `references/` only when they are actually needed.
3. Add `scripts/` only when deterministic logic would otherwise be rewritten repeatedly.
4. Be explicit about what the skill does not own.
5. Hand off to owner or sibling skills instead of absorbing adjacent workflows.
6. Do not create a new skill when tightening an existing owner or spoke is enough.
7. Every skill inherits the repo-wide premise verification gate from `AGENTS.md` and the shared truth-first operating kernel.
8. Skills that answer, review, plan, or merge must explicitly avoid blind agreement with prompt claims. They should verify current repo contracts before treating a claim as true.
9. When a task includes phrases such as `missing`, `not implemented`, `static`, `dynamic`, `duplicate`, `safe`, `ready`, `working before`, or `should be easy`, the owning skill must classify the claim as `already_exists`, `partially_exists`, `missing`, `future_state_only`, `wrong_direction`, or `needs_verification` before recommending a path.
10. If a capability already exists, the skill must route the user toward extending the existing contract rather than creating a parallel path.
11. If a capability exists transiently but is not durable, the skill should name the real gap precisely: persistence, schema, generated contract, tests, docs, UI visibility, observability, consent, vault, cache, or deployment parity.
12. Skills that ask operator questions for non-trivial planning must use the shared planning question contract: `Current truth`, `Recommended path`, `Risk if accepted blindly`, `Decision needed`, and recommended option first.
13. Maintain the compact-kernel pattern:
   - `SKILL.md` contains purpose, ownership, operating sequence, handoffs, and required checks.
   - `references/` contains detailed gates, examples, templates, and calibration notes that are loaded only when relevant.
   - `scripts/` contains repeatable classification, reporting, linting, or generation logic.
   - `workflow.json` and `skill.json` contain routing and machine-readable metadata.
14. Do not patch skills by appending every newly discovered miss to the main workflow. First decide whether the fix belongs in a script, a focused reference, a workflow playbook, or a shorter operating rule.
15. Treat a skill as bloated when the main `SKILL.md` becomes a mixed incident ledger, comment-template inventory, domain checklist, and workflow procedure in one file. The correction is extraction, not deleting the governance constraint.
16. A scan for skill quality should report line count, owned-surface breadth, whether focused references exist, whether deterministic scripts exist, and whether the main skill still reads as an operating kernel.

## Coverage baseline

The local validator treats these as meaningful maintained surfaces:

1. `README.md`
2. `bin`
3. `scripts`
4. `config`
5. `deploy`
6. `docs`
7. `hushh-webapp/app`
8. `hushh-webapp/components`
9. `hushh-webapp/lib`
10. `hushh-webapp/__tests__`
11. `hushh-webapp/scripts`
12. `hushh-webapp/docs`
13. `hushh-webapp/ios`
14. `hushh-webapp/android`
15. `consent-protocol/api`
16. `consent-protocol/hushh_mcp`
17. `consent-protocol/tests`
18. `consent-protocol/docs`
19. `consent-protocol/scripts`
20. `packages/hushh-mcp`
21. `data`
22. `.codex/skills`

## Validation rules

The local lint tool checks for:

1. required sections
2. required skill manifest keys
3. required workflow-pack keys
4. unique primary scope
5. declared role and owner family
6. owner/spoke consistency
7. explicit handoff guidance
8. missing referenced docs, scripts, or owned repo surfaces
9. broad trigger language inside spokes
10. orphaned meaningful repo surfaces
11. workflow-pack owner/default-skill consistency
12. workflow-pack routing, verification, and handoff completeness
13. non-blocking context-size and modularity review advisories for oversized skills, docs, and code modules

Context-size advisories are review triggers, not failures. They mean the next material edit should consider extracting a bounded reference, workflow playbook, doc, service, or component before adding more content. They do not require splitting working surfaces with passing checks.
