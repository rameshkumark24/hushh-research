# Hussh Comms Community Skill

## Purpose and Trigger

- Primary scope: `comms-community-intake`
- Trigger on Discord or public-chat reply drafting where the answer must be grounded in current repo docs and shipped boundaries.
- Avoid overlap with `docs-governance` and `repo-context`.

## Coverage and Ownership

- Role: `owner`
- Owner family: `comms-community`

Owned repo surfaces:

1. `.codex/skills/comms-community`

Non-owned surfaces:

1. `docs-governance`
2. `repo-context`

## Do Use

1. Drafting concise public replies about shipped architecture, trust boundaries, roadmap boundaries, or repo-backed technical answers.
2. Distinguishing clearly between current behavior and future direction.
3. Selecting only the smallest set of evidence-bearing docs needed for the answer.
4. Drafting repo-backed internal Q&A replies where the question may reference files, test failures, or implementation concerns that need verification before answering.
5. Drafting Discord-ready announcements or replies that intentionally use native Discord markdown for pacing, emphasis, quotes, lists, and compact calls to action.

## Do Not Use

1. Internal docs restructuring or repo-governance work.
2. Product implementation, debugging, or operational workflows.
3. Broad repo-orientation requests that should begin with `repo-context`.

## Read First

1. `.codex/skills/comms-community/references/reply-rules.md`
2. `.codex/skills/codex-skill-authoring/references/truth-first-operating-kernel.md`
3. `docs/reference/iam/README.md`
4. `consent-protocol/docs/reference/developer-api.md`

## Workflow

1. Infer the real architectural question before drafting the reply.
2. Read only the minimum repo docs needed to answer that exact question.
3. Start with the direct answer and separate shipped behavior from future direction.
4. For repo-backed Q&A, verify the premise first:
   - confirm the referenced file, module, or test surface exists in the current tree
   - confirm the reported concern is actually visible in the current repo state when feasible
   - classify material claims with the truth-first labels before drafting
   - if the premise is not grounded, say that directly before suggesting any fix
5. For material founder-language, product-direction, One/Kai/Nav, PCHP/BYOA, PKM/World Model, or roadmap replies, use the Founder Wiki North-Star Probe as a local evidence lane while keeping public replies public-safe. Private wiki evidence must not be cited or exposed unless the user explicitly asks for a private/internal draft; repo/wiki disagreement is `current_state_vs_north_star_drift`.
6. For drafted reply/Q&A requests, default to exactly two named outputs:
   - `Brief reply`: sendable now, short, direct, evidence-backed
   - `Detailed reply`: same answer with one more layer of reasoning or context
   Add `Firmer reply` only when the user asks for sharper wording or the premise is materially wrong enough that a separate correction helps.
7. When the user asks for a Discord-formatted post, announcement, cinematic cadence, launch note, or channel message, use native Discord formatting deliberately:
   - use `#`, `##`, or `###` headings only when the channel message benefits from a clear top-level scan point; include a space after the heading marker
   - use `-#` subtext sparingly for one quiet context line, not as body copy
   - bold only the anchor phrase, decision, or headline; avoid bolding whole paragraphs
   - use short line breaks for cadence
   - use `>` for one defining sentence or motto, and `>>>` only for a deliberate multi-line quote block
   - use bullets for scan paths, workflow steps, and proof points; avoid Markdown tables because they are noisy in Discord chat
   - use inline code for repo paths, commands, lanes, branches, IDs, and exact file names
   - use fenced code blocks only for commands or copy/paste snippets, not for normal prose
   - use masked links when the URL is useful but visually noisy, and expose critical repo paths as inline code when teammates need to find local files
   - avoid spoilers, mentions, and role pings unless the user explicitly asks for them
8. Discord message length guard:
   - treat `2000` characters as the official hard message-content limit from Discord's developer docs
   - use `1900` characters as the default safe copy budget so labels, edits, and pasted formatting do not push the message over the hard limit
   - before finalizing any Discord post, count the drafted message; if it exceeds the safe budget, split it into copy-ready batches
   - do not rely on Nitro/client-specific longer-message behavior unless the user explicitly asks for that target
   - for long posts, output `Discord copy batch 1/N`, `2/N`, etc. with each batch inside its own fenced block so the user can copy one Discord-safe message at a time
   - prefer splitting at paragraph or section boundaries; if one paragraph exceeds the limit, split at a word boundary
   - use `.codex/skills/comms-community/scripts/discord_chunk.py` for deterministic chunking when the message is long or close to the limit
9. For Discord posts that explain a Codex skill, use this structure by default:
   - headline: what was created or changed
   - one-line thesis in a block quote
   - `What it does`: 3-5 bullets focused on outcomes
   - `How the flow works`: compact numbered or bulleted flow from command/report to review action
   - `Why it matters`: trust, speed, duplication control, maintainer leverage
   - `Where to look`: local path, ignored/generated status, and the canonical skill/script surface
   - `How to use it next`: one concrete next command or workflow
10. Choose evidence format by audience:
   - public/community and internal shareable Q&A: prefer canonical GitHub markdown doc links on `main`, not repo-relative paths
   - internal repo-debug Q&A: file links or GitHub issue/PR links are allowed when they directly prove the point
11. If the question asks for the current architecture doc, cite the maintained top-level doc first and only then mention narrower subsystem docs.
12. Do not invent certainty from a vague teammate report. If the concern is branch-local or not present in the current tree, say so and ask for the exact path, log, or PR.

## Handoff Rules

1. If the work becomes docs-home governance, use `docs-governance`.
2. If the question cannot be answered cleanly without first mapping the repo or choosing the right owner family, start with `repo-context`.
3. If the task stops being public communication and becomes product or operational work, route to the correct owner skill.

## Required Checks

```bash
./bin/hushh docs verify
python3 .codex/skills/comms-community/scripts/discord_chunk.py --self-test
```
