Use this as the north-star entrypoint for the Hussh platform stack, its integration contracts, and the supporting runtime/data references.

The architecture docs use the founder-language dual-label contract defined in [founder-language-matrix.md](./founder-language-matrix.md): founder terms lead when describing system meaning, and implementation labels remain explicit when a reader needs route, token, package, or runtime precision.

Brand and compatibility rules live in [../operations/brand-and-compatibility-contract.md](../operations/brand-and-compatibility-contract.md).
