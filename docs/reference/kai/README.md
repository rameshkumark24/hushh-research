Kai-specific architecture, runtime, rollout, and audit references live here.

Within the seven-layer platform architecture, Kai spans Layer 5 through Layer 7: intelligence, experience, and channel delivery.

Kai is not the product-surface owner for all of One. Keep this directory focused on the current finance specialist runtime: portfolio, market intelligence, brokerage, RIA, voice/search/actionability, finance safety, and decision receipts. Planning for One as the broader product surface lives in [../../future/one-product-surface-evolution-plan.md](../../future/one-product-surface-evolution-plan.md); current-state Kai claims must stay tied to checked routes, generated contracts, tests, and provider behavior.

Kai docs use founder language as part of the whole-platform vocabulary:

- `Kai` is the primary user-facing intelligence surface for the platform, not a separate platform from the repo
- `Separation of Duties` maps to the current frontend/backend trust boundary and the web-proxy/native-plugin split
- `Capability Tokens` map to `VAULT_OWNER`, consent tokens, and scoped tokens used by Kai surfaces
