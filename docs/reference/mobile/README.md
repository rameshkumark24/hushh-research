Use this index for Capacitor parity and release-readiness checks.

These docs describe the mobile side of the platform's `Separation of Duties`: one shared product contract, different transport boundaries, and release gating that proves parity rather than assuming it.

Within the seven-layer platform architecture, mobile is the main Layer 6 and Layer 7 delivery surface.
