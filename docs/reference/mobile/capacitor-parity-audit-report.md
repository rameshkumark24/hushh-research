# Capacitor Parity Audit Report


## Visual Context

Canonical visual owner: [Mobile Index](README.md). Use that map for the top-down system view; this page is the narrower detail beneath it.

Last audited: May 7, 2026

Founder-language note: this report is evidence for `Separation of Duties`, not a new architecture concept. It confirms that the mobile delivery boundary stayed aligned with the shared platform contract at the audit date above.

## Overall Status

Current status: release-gate pass with no accepted parity exceptions.

The following all pass together:

- `bash scripts/ci/orchestrate.sh all`
- `bash scripts/ci/docs-parity-check.sh`
- `cd hushh-webapp && npm run verify:capacitor:static`
- `xcodebuild -list -project ios/App/App.xcodeproj`
- `./gradlew tasks --all`

## Blockers

None at the time of this audit.

The repo now hard-fails when:

- the canonical app route contract in `hushh-webapp/lib/navigation/routes.ts` drifts from the docs/runtime contract
- native microphone permission metadata is missing while Kai voice uses `getUserMedia({ audio: true })`
- native route inventory omits a `ROUTES` entry or leaves a legacy route unclassified
- route-facing browser-only APIs bypass shared wrappers or explicit exemptions
- docs drift from the current runtime/native contract

## Accepted Exceptions

None.

Android passkey PRF is part of the shipped native contract, and cloud-backed preference storage is the canonical cross-platform behavior rather than an exception.

## Advisory Follow-Up

### 1. Keep route classification current

Any new visible page must be added to:

- `hushh-webapp/lib/navigation/routes.ts`
- `docs/reference/architecture/route-contracts.md`

### 2. Keep browser APIs behind wrappers

Route-facing code should continue to use:

- `hushh-webapp/lib/utils/clipboard.ts`
- `hushh-webapp/lib/utils/browser-navigation.ts`
- `hushh-webapp/lib/utils/session-storage.ts`
- `hushh-webapp/lib/utils/native-download.ts`

Current registry-backed direct usage that must remain intentional and documented:

- navigation mutation:
  - `hushh-webapp/components/app-ui/route-error-boundary.tsx`
  - `hushh-webapp/components/vault/vault-lock-guard.tsx`
  - `hushh-webapp/lib/consent/use-consent-actions.ts`
- IndexedDB:
  - `hushh-webapp/lib/services/device-resource-cache-service.ts`
  - `hushh-webapp/lib/services/secure-resource-cache-service.ts`

Native auth storage note:

- `HushhAuth` persists native auth tokens through secure platform storage (`Keychain` / `Keystore`) rather than general user defaults or browser storage.

### 3. Keep Apple capability docs aligned

If entitlements change, update:

- `deploy/apple_app_id_capabilities.md`
- `deploy/app_store_deployment.md`
- `docs/guides/mobile.md`

in the same change.
