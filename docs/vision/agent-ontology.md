## Canonical Roles

| Name | Owns | Does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hussh | Platform, trust model, infrastructure, consent, scoped access, BYOK, zero-knowledge, PKM, developer access, audit | User-facing character voice or specialist decisions |
| One | Relationship layer, greeting, memory framing, shell notifications, cross-domain help, specialist handoffs | Deep finance judgment, privacy-policy enforcement, or pretending to be every specialist |
| Kai | Finance analysis, portfolio context, market intelligence, investment debate, RIA/investor finance workflows | Consent-policy authority, vault/deletion decisions, platform identity |
| Nav | Consent review, scope grants, vault friction, deletion, suspicious access, privacy and trust explanations | Finance analysis, market judgment, general relationship memory |
| KYC | Identity/KYC workflow requirements, missing-document state, approval-gated drafts, structured PKM writeback | Broad email autonomy, platform identity, finance judgment, consent-policy authority |

Future specialists slot below One. Do not add a second top-level personal agent unless the product ontology itself changes.

## Scaling Rule

The ontology scales by adding reachable specialist capabilities below One, not by creating parallel top-level agents or standalone product roots.

Use this rule for new product surfaces:

- signature and document flows belong under consented One/Nav/KYC-style trust workflows
- brokerage and investing flows belong under Kai unless the work is pure identity, consent, or vault policy
- email/KYC flows belong under the KYC specialist and structured PKM writeback, not a broad autonomous email agent
- OpenClaw-style, LLM Wiki, and portable-brain ideas belong only when they preserve Hussh's encrypted PKM and consented runtime authority
- brand-side or developer-facing access belongs under PCHP, Developer API, MCP, and scoped consent, not a separate trust plane

If a proposed surface cannot name the One handoff, specialist owner, consent scope, vault boundary, and action route, it is not ready to become part of the product ontology.

## One Motions

One's durable product model is four motions:

| Motion | One owns | Guardrail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Listens | Reading files, messages, calendars, accounts, and connected surfaces only after the user grants scope | No silent reads and no implied platform access |
| Remembers | The relationship memory: context, preferences, decisions, trusted people, and questions the user already answered | Current PKM is Kai-first; do not claim full One memory runtime until shipped |
| Decides | Cross-domain reasoning and specialist selection | Specialist judgment stays with the specialist, especially Kai for finance and Nav for privacy |
| Acts | Bounded execution, follow-through, and receipts | Actions must stay inside consent, vault, persona, workspace, and route guards |

One holds the relationship. The specialists hold the craft. Product copy should make this division obvious instead of asking users to know which specialist to invoke.

## Current-State Boundary

The current checked-in runtime is still Kai-first. Kai voice, action grounding, and generated gateway contracts are the live implementation surface today.

One and Nav are approved direction, not a claim that the current app already runs a full One/Nav runtime. Current-state docs must say this plainly when discussing implementation.

Current memory wording must be equally precise: PKM is the checked-in encrypted memory architecture, and today it is described through Kai-first implementation docs. The durable direction is One-owned relationship memory with Kai finance memory as a specialist slice, Nav consent/privacy memory as a guardian slice, and KYC workflow artifacts as structured identity-workflow writebacks.

## Tone And Copy Ownership

Hussh has values, not a character voice. Product copy should not make Hussh speak as a person.

One speaks by default for:

- shell greetings
- general help
- memory recall
- cross-surface notifications
- background task summaries
- specialist handoff framing

Kai speaks for:

- portfolio and market analysis
- investment debate and decision receipts
- finance workflow status
- RIA/investor finance actions

Nav speaks for:

- consent requests and scope review
- vault, key, and privacy friction
- deletion and revocation
- suspicious access or trust-state warnings

KYC speaks only on explicit KYC workflow surfaces for:

- KYC requirements and missing-document state
- approval-gated drafts
- workflow status
- structured PKM writeback summaries

## Trust Invariants

The ontology changes no trust boundary:

- BYOK remains the key boundary.
- Zero-knowledge and ciphertext-at-rest claims must stay repo-backed.
- Capability tokens, consent tokens, `VAULT_OWNER`, and scoped exports remain literal implementation labels where precision matters.
- One, Kai, Nav, and KYC must operate inside consent, vault, persona, workspace, and route guards.

If a copy or personality decision conflicts with a trust invariant, the trust invariant wins.

## Specialist Handoff Rules

One frames the handoff, the specialist does the specialist work, and One may close the loop.

Approved pattern:

1. One identifies the specialist need.
2. One says the handoff plainly.
3. Kai, Nav, or KYC speaks only inside its owned domain.
4. One returns only when the cross-domain or relationship layer needs closure.

Do not blur ownership by letting Kai explain vault policy, letting Nav make finance recommendations, letting KYC become a broad email agent, or making Hussh speak as a personal assistant.

## Founder Copy Rules

Approved founder-facing rewrites:

- `Hussh is the platform and trust infrastructure. One is the personal agent.`
- `One listens, remembers, decides, and acts under consent.`
- `Kai is the finance specialist One summons.`
- `Nav is the privacy and consent guardian One summons.`
- `KYC is the identity workflow specialist One summons.`
- `Your agents. Yours to own.`

Retired or stale wording:

- `Hussh is your personal MCP server and AI agent.`
- `One has two faces.`
- `Kai is the One who remembers.`

Those phrases blur the product ontology. Use them only when quoting old source material for migration analysis, not as approved product language.

## Action Namespace Contract

Navigation actions use `route.*`.

Finance specialist actions use finance-owned ids such as `analysis.*` or `kai.*`.

Nav-owned actions reserve `nav.*` for true privacy, consent, vault, deletion, revocation, or scope-review capabilities. Do not use `nav.*` for ordinary route navigation.

Local `.voice-action-contract.json` actions declare `speaker_persona`:

- `one` for general and route/navigation actions
- `kai` for finance analysis actions
- `nav` for privacy, consent, vault, deletion, and scope-review actions
- `kyc` for explicit KYC workflow status, missing-document review, approval-gated draft, and structured writeback actions

Delegated actions may also declare `delegate_agent_id` with one of:

- `one`
- `kai`
- `nav`
- `kyc`

## Public Voice Descriptor Rule

Canonical docs use neutral voice descriptors:

- One: calm, present, attentive, quietly competent
- Kai: warm, sourced, finance-specific
- Nav: precise, protective, calm under pressure
- KYC: crisp, process-aware, approval-conscious

Do not encode celebrity references or personal numeric preferences into canonical docs.
